## Got a SIM Card (U.S.)

I need a U.S. Cellphone Number for register Google account and Apple ID.
Since I am in China, I have to choose a mobile service that allows me to roam in China.
Ultra Mobile $3/mo card , Roaming and Wi-Fi Calling . No Data package .

Since there is no way to use cellular data traffic, a VPN is required. Make sure the ip address is located in the United States.

Generally, there are not many problems with registration, but it is almost difficult to successfully register for bank transactions and e-commerce platforms with high risk control.
In the future, it is necessary to add a mobile phone number with a native American IP that can access the Internet globally and will not change at will.

## Email & Google account

With this mobile phone number, it is very convenient to register accounts for various online services.

No need to worry about the failure to register due to the use of virtual platforms or virtual numbers.

## Social account

- Twitter @TomHiddenPeak
- Reddit u/TomHiddenPeak
- Telegram @Hiddenpeak
- Quora Thomas Hiddenpeak

The creation of these accounts is not the account of the company, and no business-related recommendations will be made, but my scenes and details will be shown.

## Set up corporation
