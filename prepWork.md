## 1. Define our vision

> Making amazing technology easier and cheaper.

Whenever I see amazing effects created by cool technology, I can always be stopped by the high price and complicated usage.So, I started trying to solve the problem a little bit to make it easier to use. In the process, I also became more powerful to realize various creations.

I have been sharing my creative process in the hope that others will find more problems to solve and interesting application scenarios.

More and more works are liked by people and even want to buy them.
