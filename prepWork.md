## 1. Define our vision

> Making amazing technology easier and cheaper.

Whenever I see amazing effects created by cool technology, I can always be stopped by the high price and complicated usage.So, I started trying to solve the problem a little bit to make it easier to use. In the process, I also became more powerful to realize various creations.

I have been sharing my creative process in the hope that others will find more problems to solve and interesting application scenarios.More and more works are liked by people and even want to buy them.

Once again creating a company that incubates dreams, open source and do it together.

## 2. Research our market opportunity

After more than ten years of development, the open source hardware ecosystem has gradually matured, helping many makers realize their whimsical ideas, and also helping many companies complete rapid prototyping. Various open source agreements make the maker ecosystem very active, but also limit the commercialization of open source hardware to a low level.

Try to develop applications using open source hardware, keeping hardware design and software functionality open source. The user interface and interactive logic are packaged into commercial firmware and distributed to users by subscription.

It not only has the characteristics of rapid development and iteration, but also has the continuous business model of firmware subscription.

The slogan is loud, but people may not believe it. Success stories need to be shown in front of people. Miracles do not wait to come, but create their own hands.

Just like making hardware, proofing first.

### 2.1 Select a product or service

I need some tools for my films. However they are too expensive to buy. For example, the DJi 3DToF module for autofouce, it's over $600.
I try to make a tool for autofocus,measuring by ToF sensor and controlling with BLE.
Only for BMD Camera Now.

The Hardware is open source. All functions are open source too. Everyone can use the source files for free.
The ROMs are subscriptions by $100 per year.
